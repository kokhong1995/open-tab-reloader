# Open Tab Reloader
The intention of this open-source add-on project is to provide a simple solution for users to reload tabs with time-intervals automatically. Besides, due to the facts that the source code of OTR is available in public and OTR uses minimum permissions for achieving goals, users are safe to use this add-on on the Firefox browser. 

Features:
- Reload tabs with custom time-intervals (by providing days, hours, minutes, and seconds). 
- Reload tabs by bypassing cache (optional). 
- Only minimum permissions are required (storage: for storing user's preferences, tabs: for managing tabs).
